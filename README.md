# viginere-cipher
Simple Ruby script which takes a string and a keyword as parameters, and encodes the string with the keyword using a basic viginere cipher.

# adiabatic 
Relatively straightforward formula for adiabatic lapse rate calculations. Provides stability for each kilometric zone, cloud thickness, some other stuff. It's been a long time since I've touched either of these, and they're both pretty poorly written. I'll refactor at somet point, maybe.
